This Project is for the Individual Project of Practical Computer Vision

It consist of two parts

(1) Yolo v8

For the Yolo v8 training and evaluation, I am using the ultranalytics code base.

(2) Faster-RCNN

For the Faster-RCNN training and evalution, I am using the mmdetection code base.


Dataset

I used fiftyone to convert the Kitti dataset to COCO format, and kitti_for_yolo to convert Kitti dataset to YOLO format.
